    <p class="mx-8">Set Theory, broadly speaking, is the branch of mathematics that deals with the formal properties of sets.
        Sets, as they are usually conveived, have <i>elements</i> or <i>members</i>. A set itself may also be an element of some other set.
     </p>
     <p class="mx-8">
        The principle concept of set theory is that of belonging. If <i>x</i> belongs to <i>A</i>, or if <i>x</i> is an element or member of <i>A</i>, then we shall write that:
     </p>
     <center><p>$x \epsilon A$</p></center>
     <p class="mx-8">Belonging is not always reflexive. Belonging is not transitive as well. </p>
     <p class="mx-8">Another principle concept of set theory is that of equality, which is just:</p>
     <center><p>$A=B$</p></center>
     <p class="mx-8">The most basic axiom of set theory, therefore, is the relationship between the property of belonging and the property of equality, which is the <b>Axiom of Extension:</b></p>
     <center><p><i>Axiom of Extension: Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements</i></p></center>
     <p class="mx-8">Moving on to subsets, if <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are sets and if every element of <i>A</i> is an element of <i>B</i>, then we can say that <i>A</i> is a subset of <i>B</i>, and we can write:</p>
     <center><p>$A \subset B$</p></center>
     <p class="mx-8">The definition implies that each set must be included in itself, making set inclusion reflexive. Set invlusion can also be seen as transitive. Set inclusion is also antisymmetric, meaning that if A is a subset of B, B does not have to be a subset of A. 
        Because of this property, almost all proofs of equalities between two sets A nad B are split into two parts, first show that A is a subset of B and then show that B is a subset of A.
     </p>
     <p class="mx-8">If <i>A</i> is a proper subset of <i>B</i>, meaning that the two sets are not equal, then we can write:</p>
     <center><p>$A \subseteq B$</p></center>
     <p class="mx-8">Before moving onto the second axiom of set theory, lets pause for a momnet to explore set sentences. 
        There are two basic types of sentneces, which is the assertions of belonging and the assertions of equality, with all other sentences obtained from these atomic sentneces by using other logical operatores.
     </p>
     <p class="mx-8">The second axiom of set theory, the <b>Axiom of Specification</b>, states that:</p>
     <center><p><i>The Axiom of Specification: To every set A and every condition S(x), there corresponds a set B whose elements are exactly those elements of x of A for which S(x) holds</i></p></center>
     <p class="mx-8">In other words, given a set N, we can construct a subst <i>x</i> such that:</p>
     <center><p>${[x| x \epsilon N \cap xS(x)]}$</p></center>
     <p class="mx-8">A cool application of this axiom is to prove that there is no universe. Consider the condition that x is not a member of x. Then it logically follows that if B = {x| x is a member of A and x is not a member of x}, then y is a member of set B if and only if y is a member of A and y is not a member of y
        So therefore, can it be that B is a member of A? After caseworking this problem into 2 cases, we find out that if B is a member of B, then B is not a member of B, a contradiction. If B is not a member of B, then B must be a member of B, another contradiction.
        Therefore, we arrive at the conclusion that B is not a member of A, which means that nothing contains everything, or there is no such thing as a universe set. This is called the famous Russell Paradox
     </p>
     <p class="mx-8">Are there enough sets to ensure that every set is an element of some set. Is there a principle that allows us to contruct new sets with old sets without any specification? The answer is the <b>Axiom of Pairing</b>:</p>
     <center><p>Axiom of Pairing: For any two sets there exists a set that they both belong to</p></center>
     <p class="mx-8">A pair is a set that contains only A and B and nothing else, abbreviated as {a, b}. A singleton is a set that only has another set as its element. This happens when we form a set with a and a, abbreviated as {a, a} or just {a} </p>
     <p class="mx-8">The axiom of pairing ensures that every set is an element of some set and that ny two sets are simultaenously elements of some one and the same set</p>
